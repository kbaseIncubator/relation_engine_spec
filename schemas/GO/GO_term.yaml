  name:
    type: string
    description: The term name. Any term may have only one name defined.
    examples:
    - mitochondrial genome maintenance
    - reproduction
  alt_id:
    type: array
    description: Defines an alternate id for this term. A term may have any number
      of alternate ids.

  comment:
    type: string
    description: A comment for this term.
    examples:
    - This term was made obsolete because it refers to a class of gene products and
      a biological process rather than a molecular function.
  subset:
    type: array
    description: This tag indicates a term subset to which this term belongs.
    examples:
    - - goslim_yeast
    - - goslim_chembl
      - goslim_metagenomics
      - goslim_pir
      - goslim_plant
  synonym:
    type: array
    description: This tag gives a synonym for this term, some xrefs to describe the
      origins of the synonym, and may indicate a synonym category or scope information.

  xref:
    type: array
    description: A dbxref that describes an analagous term in another vocabulary
    examples:
    - - Wikipedia:Reproduction
    - - KEGG_REACTION:R05612
      - RHEA:20836
  is_a:
    type: array
    description: 'This tag describes a subclassing relationship between one term and
      another. The value is the id of the term of which this term is a subclass. '
    examples:

    - - GO:0051231 ! spindle elongation
      - GO:1903047 ! mitotic cell cycle process
  intersection_of:
    type: array

    - - GO:0008150 ! biological_process
      - regulates GO:0006312 ! mitotic recombination
  disjoint_from:
    type: array
    description: 'This tag indicates that a term is disjoint from another, meaning
      that the two terms have no instances or subclasses in common. '
    examples:
    - - GO:0044848 ! biological phase
    - - GO:0003697 ! single-stranded DNA binding
  relationship:
    type: array
    description: This tag describes a typed relationship between this term and another
      term. The value of this tag should be the relationship type id, and then the
      id of the target term.
    examples:
    - - regulates GO:0006312 ! mitotic recombination
    - - part_of GO:0000070 ! mitotic sister chromatid segregation
